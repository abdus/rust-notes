title: Data Types
---

> Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.

## Data Types in Rust:

1. **Scalar**
   - Integers
     - (`i8 | u8`) - 8-bit Integer
     - (`i16 | u16`) - 16-bit Integer
     - (`i32 | u32`) - 32-bit Integer
     - (`i64 | u64`) - 64-bit Integer
     - (`i128 | u128`) - 128-bit Integer
     - (`isize | usize`) - Integer size depends upon the system architecture.
   - Floating Point Numbers
     - `f32` - Single-precision 32-bit floating point numbers
     - `f64`(default) - Single-precision 64-bit floating point numbers
   - Booleans
     - `true`
     - `false`
   - Characters
     - `char` - 4-bytes in size. Capable of holding an Unicode Scalar Value(including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces etc)
2. Compound
   - Tuple
   - Array
